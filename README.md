## About

**NOTE: devExamples is currently being fixed as the original author did not make it suitable for GitHub Pages.**

**NOTE 2: Transferring to TtRchives.**

**[devExamples.cf](http://devExamples.cf)** is a website with coding examples.
For every project there is an instruction and some example code.
Right now there is just Python available
If you have finished you'll get the right solution.

**This website is still a beta version**

The website is built with HTML and CSS.  
I use Bootstrap for the menu.   
The menu and the footer are included with jQuery.

## Contribute

Everyone can help me to improve this website.  
Just send me some more examples for Python or even a different language.
